# BitWise-Multiplication-nlog-n-
Multiplication bit wise. The program works at N log(N), not N^N.

Program multiplies bytes with complexity of N log(N).                                                                                     
Does not work for very large numbers.                                                                                                     
Uses expansion rule to multiply in N log(N)
